# TikTok E-commerce Strategy: Creator Incubation & Conversion Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes TikTok e-commerce data to identify high-potential creators and optimize content strategies. By leveraging **NLP**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and **Hypothesis Testing**, I uncovered key drivers for user conversion.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **The 25s Golden Rule:** Videos under 25 seconds exhibit significantly higher collect rates than longer formats.
- **Hidden Gems:** Identified a segment of "under-the-radar" creators with low views but top-tier conversion efficiency.
- **Tag Impact:** Proved that specific hashtags like `#TikTokMadeMeBuyIt` have a statistically significant impact on purchase intent ($p < 0.05$).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy (T-Tests), WordCloud, NLTK
- **Techniques:** A/B Testing logic, Log-scale Visualization, Stopword Tuning
